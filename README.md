## ðŸ“¦ Alembic Migration Guide

This project uses **Alembic** for managing database schema migrations.

### âœ… Initial Setup

1. Ensure Alembic is installed:

   ```bash
   pip install alembic

2. Make sure all your SQLAlchemy models are imported in alembic/env.py so Alembic can detect them.

3. Create a new migration (auto-detect model changes):
    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your descriptive message"

4. Apply latest migrations to the database:
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head

5. Roll back the last migration:
    ```bash
    alembic downgrade -1

6. View migration history:
    ```bash
    alembic history
